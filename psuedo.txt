# An algorithm that asks a user to enter a positive number repeatedly until the user enters a zero value, then determines and outputs the largest of the numbers that were entered.

request a positive integer from the user
store positive integers in a variable called "numbers"
request a second input of integers from user
if the second input is equal to zero
    print out highest value in "numbers"
if the second input does not equal zero
  request input until input is equal to zero
  when input is equal to zero
    print out highest value in "numbers"



# An algorithm that request a user to input their name and then stores their name as a variable called first_name along with the phrase "Hello, World".

  request user's name
  store name in a variable called "first_name"
  if the input is equal to "first_name"
  print "first_name", "Hello World"




# An algorithm that reads an arbitrary number of integers and then returns their arithmetic average.

request integer from the user
store integers in a variable called "numbers"
calculate the average by adding all of the integers together then dividing by the total number of integers 
print the average 



#An algorithm that reads a grocery list and prints out the products(in alphabetical order) that are still left to buy.

get grocery list
filter items in "grocery list" for items that have not been bought
if item in 'grocery list" is not bought 
print items in alphabetical order 



# An algorithm for the flowchart for the following page.

request an input from the user 
store input in a variable called "X"
request a second input from user
store second input in a variable called "Y"
calculate the sum by adding "X" and "Y"
store sum in a variable called "S"
calculate the average by dividing "S" by two
store the average in a variable called "A"
calculate the product by multiplying "X" and "Y"
store the product in a variable called "P"
print out "S","A","P"
